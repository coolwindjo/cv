### ABOUT ME

From 2013 to 2022, I was an **automotive software engineer** specializing in **Advanced Driver Assistance Systems** at the Vehicle Solutions company of **LG Electronics**. During the period, I contributed to the development and production of **lane detection algorithms** for _Mercedes Benz_ **mono cameras for NCAP 2020+**, which means I was involved in the development of the project from start to finish. Since 2022, I have been a **senior software engineer** with the **HiL/SiL systems** at **DXC Luxoft** company. My research interests include **software architecture**, **design pattern**, **vision-based automation** and **sensor fusion system**.
