### ABOUT ME

From 2013 to 2022, I was an **automotive software engineer** specializing in **Advanced Driver Assistance Systems** at the Vehicle Solutions company of **LG Electronics**, where I significantly contributed to the development and production of **lane detection algorithms** for *Mercedes Benz* **mono cameras for NCAP 2020+**. From March 2022 to June 2023, I served as a **senior software engineer** with the **HiL/SiL systems** at **DXC Luxoft Technology**.

Currently, since June 2023, I am an **Automotive Cybersecurity Software Engineer** at **Autocrypt Technologies GmbH**. Since October 2023, based in Germany, I primarily perform the roles of **Technical Project Manager** and **Resident Engineer** within the Global Engineering Support Team. Furthermore, since January 2024, I have been functioning as a **Project Leader** for Autocrypt Technologies GmbH in its capacity as an IDPS (Intrusion Detection and Prevention System) module supplier for a **major Tier-1 automotive supplier**, which provides RTCUs for a **leading global automotive OEM**, with the first **Start of Production (SoP) targeted for Q4 2025**.

My research interests include **software design patterns, autonomous vehicles, sensor fusion systems, automotive cybersecurity,** and **MLOps.** Recently, I am a co-author of a couple of papers including <a href="#publications"><b>LiDAR Denoising Methods in Adverse Environments: A Review</b></a> published in **IEEE Sensors Journal**, 2025, and <a href="#publications"><b>Kalman Filter-Based Suspicious Object Tracking for Border Security and Surveillance System using Fixed Automotive Radar</b></a> for **Sensor Signal Processing for Defence 2023**.
