### ABOUT ME

||
|:------------------------|
| Senior Systems Architect with 12+ years of experience delivering safety-critical automotive systems—from **Proof Of Concept (POC)** to **Start Of Production (SOP)**. Proven track record in optimizing perception pipelines and reliability engineering for **Mercedes-Benz** and **Stellantis**. I maintain technical integrity across the full **V-Model** lifecycle, from **Software Requirements Analysis (SWE.1)** through to **Qualification Testing (SWE.6)**. Driven by a lifelong "maker" spirit—transitioning from a state-level science gold prize to an **Elite Interdisciplinary Research Privilege** (Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering convergence) at **KAIST**—I bridge the gap between stochastic AI and deterministic reliability. Currently based in **Munich** with a valid **EU Blue Card**, available for immediate contribution. Off-duty, I manage paper-based quantitative asset portfolios, stay agile on a skateboard, or hit the nearby Alps—where my snowboarding dreams have finally transitioned from a distant vision to a local reality. <span class="print-hide"><br><br>I've recently published peer-reviewed research including <a href="#publications"><b>LiDAR Denoising Methods in Adverse Environments: A Review</b></a> published in IEEE Sensors Journal, 2025, and <a href="#publications"><b>Kalman Filter-Based Suspicious Object Tracking for Border Security and Surveillance System using Fixed Automotive Radar</b></a> for Sensor Signal Processing for Defence 2023.</span> |

### Glossary of Technical Terms

|||
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Model Quantization** | A technique to reduce the size and computational load of deep learning models. Quantization script converts the model to lower-bit integer formats (e.g., 8-bit, 4-bit). The system will automatically compare the quantized model's accuracy, inference speed, and memory usage against the original model. If the accuracy drop exceeds a predefined threshold, the build fails. |
| **ABI Stability** | **Application Binary Interface Stability**. Ensures that changes to the library do not break compatibility with existing compiled binaries, allowing updates without recompilation of dependent applications. Crucial for modular software architectures. |
| **ABA**, **Active Brake Assist** | Active Brake Assist system. Sends vehicle deceleration commands to avoid collisions and reduce accidents when there is a risk of forward collision. ABA is mentioned with **AEB (Automatic Emergency Braking)** and includes functions that generate warnings and braking when there is a risk of collision. One of the functions of MPC 5.5 that received **ASIL B certification**. |
| **AEB**, **Advanced Emergency Brake** / **Automatic Emergency Braking** | A system that predicts the risk of collision with a preceding vehicle and applies emergency braking to prevent or mitigate accidents. It is a core component of ABA. |
| **APTR**, **Adaptive PowerTrain Request** | A system that assists acceleration and braking according to the driving mode and forward situation while maintaining the speed and distance set by the driver. This is closely related to the **ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control)** function. |
| **ACC**, **Adaptive Cruise Control** | A system that assists driving by maintaining the speed or distance set by the driver according to road conditions and following the navigation route. Corresponds to the main function of APTR. |
| **ESS**, **Emergency Stop System** | A system that safely stops the vehicle in an emergency while keeping it in the lane if the driver is judged to be unable to drive. Unlike AEB, it performs deceleration gradually. |
| **LKA**, **Lane Keeping Assist** | A system that prevents accidents by returning the vehicle to the inside of the lane through steering intervention when lane departure is expected. One of the functions of MPC 5.5 that received **ASIL B certification**. |
| **LKAS**,**Lane Keeping Assist System** | A general term for Lane Keeping Assist System. This corresponds to the function where the Botts' dots detection component was developed. |
| **LDW**, **Lane Departure Warning** | A system that provides warnings (visual/tactile/auditory) to the driver when lane departure is expected or occurring. |
| **HUD**, **Head-Up-Display** | A system that projects vehicle information onto the windshield for the driver. MPC 5.5 provided calibration information for HUD brightness control or **AR HUD**. |
| **TSA**, **Traffic Sign Assist** / **Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR)** | A system that recognizes traffic signs to provide information to the driver and automatically changes the set speed to prevent accidents. |
| **IHC**, **Intelligent Head-Light Control** | A function that partially adjusts high beams to low beams to avoid glaring at surrounding vehicles by detecting them. Similar to **HBA (High Beam Assist)**. |
| **EME**, **Ego-Motion Estimation** | The vehicle's **self-motion estimation** algorithm, providing accurate ego-position and movement information required for perception and control functions in real-time. |
| **ASIL**, **Automotive Safety Integrity Level** | Safety Integrity Level according to the ISO 26262 functional safety standard. MPC 5.5 achieved **ASIL B** certification. |
| **ASPICE**, **Automotive Software Process Improvement and Capability dEtermination** | Automotive software development process improvement and capability determination model. The MPC 5.5 project received **Capability Level 3 (CL3)** certification. |
| **ADTF**, **Automotive Data and Time-Triggered Framework** | Automotive Data and Time-Triggered Framework. Used to implement functional signal visualization tools and develop lane detection accuracy evaluation systems. |
| **IDPS**, **Intrusion Detection and Prevention System** | Intrusion Detection and Prevention System. A core module in the automotive cybersecurity field currently being managed. |
| **RTCU**, **Roadside/Remote Telematics Control Unit** | A device responsible for communication between the vehicle and external systems. |
| **SoP**, **Start of Production** | The start of mass production for a product. |
| **D-AUTO**, **Deceleration Auto** | A feature that induces the driver to release the accelerator pedal to actively use regenerative braking. It includes the nature of "Automatic deceleration", so it is denoted as D-AUTO following internal naming conventions. |
