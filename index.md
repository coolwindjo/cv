### ABOUT ME

From 2013 to 2022, I architected **real-time computer vision algorithms** for **Mercedes-Benz ADAS** at **LG Electronics**, where I led development of **lane detection systems** achieving **NCAP 2020+ compliance** and processing 30+ FPS video streams with 99.7% accuracy. My solutions directly contributed to LG winning the **AutoSens Award for automotive innovation**. From March 2022 to June 2023, I optimized **HiL/SiL testing frameworks** at **DXC Luxoft**, reducing validation time by 45% through automated test orchestration.

Currently at **Autocrypt Technologies GmbH** since June 2023, I bridge automotive cybersecurity with modern DevOps practices as **Technical Project Manager**, overseeing IDPS development for next-generation connected vehicles. Leading a distributed team of 15+ engineers, I've implemented agile methodologies that improved delivery predictability by 60%. My role combines hands-on security architecture (**AUTOSAR-compliant IDPS**, Hardware Security Module integration, real-time threat monitoring on ARM Cortex processors) with strategic program management for a Tier-1 supplier serving a **global OEM**.

<span class="print-hide">My technical foundation spans C++ (12+ years), Python, Docker, Kubernetes, and emerging cloud technologies. I've published peer-reviewed research including <a href="#publications"><b>LiDAR Denoising Methods in Adverse Environments: A Review</b></a> published in IEEE Sensors Journal, 2025, and <a href="#publications"><b>Kalman Filter-Based Suspicious Object Tracking for Border Security and Surveillance System using Fixed Automotive Radar</b></a> for Sensor Signal Processing for Defence 2023. Actively pursuing AWS Solutions Architect certification to complement my embedded systems expertise with cloud-native architectures, positioning myself at the intersection of automotive innovation and enterprise-scale computing.</span>

### Glossary of Technical Terms

|||
|:-------------|:------------------|
| **Model Quantization** | A technique to reduce the size and computational load of deep learning models. Quantization script converts the model to lower-bit integer formats (e.g., 8-bit, 4-bit). The system will automatically compare the quantized model's accuracy, inference speed, and memory usage against the original model. If the accuracy drop exceeds a predefined threshold, the build fails.|
